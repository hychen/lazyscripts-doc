Introduction
================

Lazyscripts was released at April 1st 2009, as a replacement of Lazyubuntu. All most all the source code including core framework have been rewritten, expected for some GUI and customize scripts.

Lazybuntu was initiated by PCMan at 2009/09/25. The idea is to help Ubuntu users install and use the software. Even though Ubuntu is a very friendly Linux distribution for end users, but there are still many imperfection, especially for Chinese desktop environment, all through Ubuntu developers has already put many works on these issue, but still can not meet the common usage behavior of Taiwanese users, the default installation also leaks some common Chinese software.

Furthermore, there are multimedia related software are not included in Ubuntu official repository, because some legal or patent issues. But these software like mp3 decoder, dvd players are essential for desktop users. So, the users will need some adjustments after install Ubuntu.

Since these adjustments are the first thing to do after installation of many users. Why don't we crate a tool to help these end users, but not let them study tones of documents. Based on this idea, many developers in Taiwan, provided some software tools for system adjustments. These tools fix some problems, but many of them require operation skill on command line interface, and leaking for flexibility. If we can provide an simple GUI, then the user only need to use their mouse to fix most of the issues. This is the target of Lazybuntu, and Lazyscripts development.

At this moment, Lazyscripts support distributions like Ubuntu, Debian. The tool help the user to setup network, libraries, Chinese desktop environment, multimedia codecs, DVD playing, and some useful software. Which help the user adjust the desktop environment for common usage.

Except the basic function of Lazybuntu, Lazyscripts improved the scripts management framework, make those scripts are more easy to share, retrieve, merge, and also much better flexibility for different customization purpose.
